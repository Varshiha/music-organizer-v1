Project: music-organizer-v1. A project to collect audio files.
Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object on the object bench.
Use its methods to add, show, and remove files.

Part 1 - Music Organizer v1:
4.2: In terminal it says, musicOrg3.removeFile(). I did not get any error message. However, I was expecting to get something like "no files" in the terminal but that did not happen. 

4.3 The file that was listFile(1) became listFile(0) after calling removeFile(0). I am guessing it moved the files moved up by one. I think it has something to do with the index but I am not sure though.
