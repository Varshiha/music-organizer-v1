Project: music-organizer-v1. A project to collect audio files.
Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object on the object bench.
Use its methods to add, show, and remove files.

Part 1 - Music Organizer v1:
2: In terminal it says, musicOrg3.removeFile(). I did not get any error message. However, I was expecting to get something like "no files" in the terminal but that did not happen. 

3. The file that was listFile(1) became listFile(0) after calling removeFile(0). I am guessing it moved the files moved up by one. I think it has something to do with the index but I am not sure though.

4. Create a class named Book
  private ArrayList<Book> library;

5.Create a class named Studentt 
  ArrayList<Student> cs101;

6. Create a class named MusicTracks
private ArrayList<MusicTrack> tracks;

7. library = new ArrayList<>();
   cs101 = new ArrayList<>();
    tracks = new ArrayList<>();
8. 10 would be returned
9. public int getNumberOfItems()
{
 return items.size(4);
}
10. 14


11.public void addFavoriteTrack(String files){
        ArrayList<String> favouriteTrack;
        favouriteTrack = new ArrayList<>();
        favouriteTrack.add(files);
    

12.public void removeDate(int index){
        ArrayList<String> dates;
        dates = new ArrayList<>();
        dates.remove(2);
    }

13. It will be 5.
